# Today I learned

My personal `Today I learned` snippets. Inspired by someone on the internet.

Posting them here rather than on my blog (https://jugmac00.github.io) is a clear sign that my blogging software is not comfortable enough to use.

## PLEASE NOTE

This repository has been archived, as the contents has been migrated to my new blog: https://jugmac00.github.io/til/

New TIL entries will be announced via https://twitter.com/jugmac00.

Eventually, I possibly will setup a RSS feed for my website https://github.com/jugmac00/jugmac00.github.io/issues/4
