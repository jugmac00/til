# How can you list all open pull requests for one GitHub organization?

While most developers probably know,
that you can list all your open pull requests on GitHub via https://github.com/pulls,
how can you list all open pull requests for one GitHub organization?

I was on holiday for two weeks,
and I want to get up to speed which pull requests need to be reviewed in my company...

Luckily, there is no need to do a complicate query or work with GitHub's GraphQL API...

Just replace "ORG" with your organization and click on the following link...

https://github.com/pulls?user=ORG
