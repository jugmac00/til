# How should I capitalize headings?

Especially in English language...

I am no native English speaker and there are so many subleties in the English language,
so when I was about preparing my lightning talk submissions for both PyOhio and PyCon US,
I was super happy that my friend @eumiro sent me the following link:

https://capitalizemytitle.com/

At this site you can just paste your heading's text,
and you receive it properly capitalized,
even in different styles, e.g. APA, Chicago, AP, MLA... and many more.


P.S.: When I showed the final result to my friends @eumiro and @obestwalter,
I certainly got a big VETO! üßêü•≥

P.P.S.: I just learned: "There are no fixed rules for headings except for `tox`!" @obestwalter
